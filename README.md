# postman-collection-for-voltcloud #

a Postman collection for VoltCloud.io

This repo contains a [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) collection of REST requests against [VoltCloud.io](https://voltcloud.io/).

VoltCloud is a fairly cheap deployment server for web applications which also integrates basic user management and a simple key-value store. While originally been built for [NSB/AppStudio](https://www.nsbasic.com/), its REST interface allows it to be used from any platform which is able to handle REST requests (including cURL and Postman)

The contents of this Postman collection is based on the [available documentation](https://docs.voltcloud.io/api/), some answers to questions in the [developer forum](https://discuss.appstudio.dev/) ([here](https://discuss.appstudio.dev/t/deploying-to-volt-using-the-cli/742) and [there](https://discuss.appstudio.dev/t/how-to-get-a-list-of-registered-users/3136)) and my own research using the VoltCloud dashboard and my browser's developer tools (primarily its network log)
